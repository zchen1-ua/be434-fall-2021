Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
(Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate;
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
