# Assignment 1: Salutations

Create Python program called `saluations.py` that will print a friendly greeting.

## Installing new.py Into Your PATH

In the _bin_ directory of your repo, you should find a program called `new.py` that will help you make a new Python program.
From this directory, you can provide the full path using `..` to indicate the parent directory:

```
$ ../../bin/new.py -h
usage: new.py [-h] [-n NAME] [-e EMAIL] [-p PURPOSE] [-f] program

Create Python argparse program

positional arguments:
  program               Program name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n NAME, --name NAME  Name for docstring (default: Ken Youens-Clark)
  -e EMAIL, --email EMAIL
                        Email for docstring (default: kyclark@gmail.com)
  -p PURPOSE, --purpose PURPOSE
                        Purpose for docstring (default: Rock the Casbah)
  -f, --force           Overwrite existing (default: False)
```

It will be unpleasant to always indicate the full path to `new.py` as you will use it often.
I suggest you create a directory in your `$HOME` (which is often written using the tilde `~` AKA "twiddle") to put useful programs you'll write.
It's common to create a _~/local_ or _~/.local_ (so it's hidden) to install software, and inside of that a _bin_ directory:

```
$ mkdir ~/.local/bin
```

You will need to ensure that this directory is included in your `$PATH`.
If are using the `bash` shell, you can edit _~/.bashrc_ (or possibly _~/.bash_profile_ or even _~/.profile_).
For instance, you can use `nano`:

```
$ nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add this line to the end:

```
export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
```

Then use the `source` command to read this file and alter your `$PATH`:

```
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

The dot (`.`) is an alias for `source` when it is used as a command:

```
$ . ~/.bashrc
```

You can view your `$PATH` to ensure this directory is included:

```
$ echo $PATH
```

Then you can copy the `new.py` program to that location:

```
$ cp ../../bin/new.py ~/.local/bin
```

Verify that the program can be found using `which`:

```
$ which new.py
/Users/kyclark/.local/bin/new.py
```

## Getting Started with new.py

Here is how you can create the `salutations.py` using `new.py`:

```
$ new.py -p 'Print greeting' salutations.py
Done, see new script "salutations.py."
```

Open the new `salutations.py` program and modify it to accept three optional arguments:

* `-g|--greeting`: A greeting, defaults to "Howdy"
* `-n|--name`: A name to greeting, defaults to "Stranger"
* `-e|--excited`: A flag to terminate the greeting with an exclamation point

The program should respond to `-h|--help` to print the following usage:

```
$ ./salutations.py -h
usage: salutations.py [-h] [-g str] [-n str] [-e]

Greetings and salutations

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -g str, --greeting str
                        The greeting (default: Howdy)
  -n str, --name str    Whom to greet (default: Stranger)
  -e, --excited         Include an exclamation point (default: False)
```

When run with no arguments, it should use the default values to print the following:

```
$ ./salutations.py
Howdy, Stranger.
```

The `-g|--greeting` option should cause it to use the provided greeting:

```
$ ./salutations.py -g Sup
Sup, Stranger.
```

The `-n|--name` option should cause it to use the provided name:

```
$ ./salutations.py -n Amanda
Howdy, Amanda.
```

The `-e|--excited` flag should cause the greeting to end with a bang:

```
$ ./salutations.py -e
Howdy, Stranger!
```

The program should accept any combination of the short or long names of the arguments:

```
$ ./salutations.py --greeting Sup --name Dude --excited
Sup, Dude!
```

## Testing

The test suite will require the modules pytest, flake8, and pylint which you can install with the following command:

```
$ python3 -m pip install pytest flake8 pylint
```

You can run the test suite with the following command:

```
$ pytest -xv --pylint --flake8 test.py
```

You can also use the Makefile shortcut:

```
$ make test
```

The tests include linting with `pylint` and `flake8`, so be sure that you format your code with something like `yapf` or `black` (which may need to be installed using the `pip` module above.

A passing test suite looks like this:

```

============================== 9 passed in 0.51s ===============================
```

Your grade is whatever percentage of tests your code passes.
