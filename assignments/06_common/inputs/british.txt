I went to the theatre last night with my neighbour and had a litre of
beer, the colour and flavour of which put us into such a good humour
that we forgot our labours.  We set about to analyse our behaviour,
organise our thoughts, recognise our faults, catalogue our merits, and
generally have a dialogue without pretence as a licence to improve
ourselves.
