# Biosystems Analytics 434/534 (3 units)

Shantz 440; Monday and Wednesday 9:30-10:45AM
	
## Description of Course

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Python for data analytics. This course teaches students Python’s basic data types and structures like strings, numbers, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. In addition, the course focuses on testing code by writing small functions to develop larger, testable programs. As programs become complex, this “test-driven development strategy” ensures that code is robust and can be delivered to the community as cutting-edge open source packages. The course focuses on hands-on coding exercises to develop practical coding skills for interpreting and analyzing high-dimensional biological data. Students work in a collaborative learning classroom to participate in live coding exercises and gain skills in:

- basic Python data structures 
- writing and testing functions and programs, 
- using Python to read/write/parse files, and 
- using regular expressions. 

These skills are taught by implementing real-world coding examples to manipulate and process data in Python and test out your new skills through writing games in Python.

## Course Prerequisites or Corequisites

An Apple, Linux, or Windows computer. 
Some experience programming Python is useful but not required.

## Course Objectives

The course objective is to teach formal, structured methods to write Python well. This course introduces techniques seasoned programmers use daily, from how to start writing a new program, to how to verify that it actually works. This course teaches students regular expressions, algorithm design, and random events using simple puzzles and games. Once students have mastered these coding concepts and practices, they can be applied broadly to advanced concepts in scientific computing and biological data.
Expected Learning Outcomes
This course is designed to provide students with a foundational understanding of manipulating data in Python. Upon completing this course students will be able to: 

- Write command-line Python programs; 
- Process a variety of command-line arguments, options, and flags; 
- Write and run tests for your programs and functions; 
- Manipulate of Python data structures including strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries; 
- Use higher-order functions like map and filter; 
- Write and use regular expressions; 
- Read, parse, and write various text formats; 
- Use and control randomness; 
- Use these skills to write challenging games in Python.

Graduate students will go beyond these basic learning outcomes to (1) apply basic coding principles to solve more advanced challenges, (2) develop optimized solutions to working with large-scale datasets and (3) evaluate when it is important to move from a single server solution to high-performance computing.   

## Course Format and Teaching Methods

The course is taught using a collaborative learning approach consisting of live-coding examples that demonstrate core concepts, an interactive group assignment, a collective discussion on the material, and an introduction to the homework. Importantly, because the development of scripting skills is essential to this class, programming homework is assigned weekly to reinforce the concepts taught in class. Each homework assignment is due a week after it was assigned. Students are quizzed on the material once a week on Tuesdays. At the end of the semester, students will implement code for a novel program via the class project. Undergraduates may choose from a set of simple games, whereas graduate students will program more complex games. Graduate students are also required to take a final examination comprised of small coding assignments based on concepts taught throughout the semester. 

## Absence and Class Participation Policy

Attending lectures and participating are vital to the learning process given the hands-on nature of the class. As such, attendance is required at all lectures. Students who miss class due to illness or emergency are required to bring documentation from their health-care provider or other relevant, professional third parties. Failure to submit third-party documentation will result in unexcused absences.

The UA’s policy concerning Class Attendance, Participation, and Administrative Drops is available at http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/class-attendance-participation-and-administrative-drop 


The UA policy regarding absences for any sincerely held religious belief, observance or practice will be accommodated where reasonable, http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/religious-accommodation-policy.

Absences pre-approved by the UA Dean of Students (or Dean Designee) will be honored.  See:  https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/absences  

Makeup Policy for Students Who Register Late
Students who register after the first class meeting may make up missed assignments/quizzes within the first two weeks of class.

## Required or Special Materials

Students will be required to create a (free) account on GitHub to download and turn in assignments. Students must install Python on their laptops for completing and turning in assignments. Windows users will need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in order to have a functional command-line interface. Students will also need to install an editor. In this class, we use Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), but students are welcome to use a different editor of their choice. Information on accessing these resources can be found under Getting Started in D2L. We walk-through these resources in-class during the first week of the course.

## Required Extracurricular, Activities

Optional software carpentry workshops and events related to Python data analytics will be announced in D2L.

University policy regarding grades and grading systems is available at http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system.

Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in accordance with University policies, which are available at http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#incomplete and http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#Withdrawal respectively.

Dispute of Grade Policy: Disputes on a grade for an assignment, quiz, or exam must be made within three days of when the grade is posted.

## Assignments and Examinations

All assignments, quizzes, and examinations are listed on the course GitHub site https://github.com/hurwitzlab/biosystems-analytics-2020 and linked in D2L. 

Homework is assigned every Thursday and is due the following Thursday. The homework provides you with practice in scripting and analytics. Homework is turned in by committing your code to your GitHub repository that is shared with the instructor. At the beginning of class on Thursday, I will download your code from GitHub. Your grade will be the percentage of tests you pass in the provided test suite.. We encourage group work but be sure the code you turn in has been independently written (see Code of Academic Integrity below). 

## Quizzes

Each week you will be tested on the reading for the week ahead (see the schedule in D2L). This will prepare you for the lectures and in-class work. Each of the quizzes will be available on D2L during the first 10 minutes of class on Tuesdays. Answers for each quiz are reviewed in class and posted on the class D2L website.

## Final Project

At the end of the semester, students will implement a novel program in Python via the class project that demonstrates the core programming concepts for the class. The project will include documentation (a README), a program, a test suite, and any required input/data to run the program. The program may be a game, a solution to a problem from something like Rosalind.info, or some program needed by your lab or PI to further your research. Graduate students will be expected to create more detailed and involved programs than undergraduates.
Final Examination
The final exam (for graduate students only) will be drawn from a sample of small coding assignments to be completed during the final using programming concepts in Python discussed throughout the semester. The core concepts will be highlighted each week as expected learning outcomes and given as practice in homework assignments. The final is an open note and open book exam.
